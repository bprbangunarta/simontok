## About

This starter pack can be considered a strong foundation for starting a Laravel project quickly and efficiently, so developers can focus on developing more specific features without having to start from scratch every time they create a new project.

## Features

- Predefined project directory and file structure, including folders for controllers, models, views, migrations, seeders, and more.
- Basic configurations such as database settings, env files, and other settings that are often needed in Laravel projects.
- Implementation of an authentication and authorization system that is prepared by default, including login, register, password reset and user management features.
- Integration with Spatie for role and permission management, which allows users to define roles such as admin, editor, or regular user, as well as set permissions for each role.
